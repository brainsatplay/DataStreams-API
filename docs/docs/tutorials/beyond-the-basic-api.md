# Beyond the Basic API

## WebRTC
The Data Capture and Streams API can be used to stream arbitrary data through WebRTC using the `datastreams-webrtc` (coming soon) package.

A working example of the WebRTC extension can be found [here](../../examples?name=webrtc)

## Transforms
The Data Capture and Streams API is intended for the processing of real-time data streams from the browser. We are updating the [datastreams-transforms](https://github.com/brainsatplay/datastreams-transform) repository with useful functions for both (1) time-series analysis like biquad filters (e.g. high-pass, low-pass, etc.) and time-frequency decomposition (e.g Fast Fourier Transform), as well as (2) MediaStream transforms for audio and video.

In order to format functions as transformations, you can use the following structure:
